## Social Network NoSQL API
## Description

The purpose of this project was to develop skills and learn the basics of using NoSQL, in this case I used MongoDB and Mongoose. The project entails the backed of a website API where individuals can have a username, an email and with their account they can create thoughts and under those thoughts are reactions, think of like a comment section. During my time coding this project I learnt many things about mongoose such as the query and projection operators.
